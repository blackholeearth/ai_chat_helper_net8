 convert html to Markdown .  And Merge Them in to single file.

50% vibed with gemini 2.5 ...

### requiremets
 * windows 10 ,11
 * install .net8  - [here -> .NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.15-windows-x64-installer)

#### WHY?  

* gemini doesn't take files that are in subfolder of "selected folder".
* i needed it to restructure my code files into better hierarcy.
  * so you need to feed gemini with file paths.
* i was tired doing it repeated when chat crashes at "google AI studio".
